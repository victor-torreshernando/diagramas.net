# Contribution Guidelines

If you are joining the project right now, please read the [guide to your first contributions](/doc/your-first-contributions.md) first for context and preparations.

Then, this document describes how to send a contribution to the project:

1. [Definitions](#definitions): **please this section first**.
1. [InnerSource Contribution](#innersource-contribution): describes the process of proposing a new feature or fix to the project.
1. [Sending a contribution](#sending-a-contribution): describes how to send a contribution to the project once it was accepted to be scheduled.
1. [Branch Policy](#branch-policy): describes the project's branching strategy.
1. [Additional Documentation](#additional-documentation): some extra stuff that may be worth reading before start working on your contribution.

Once sent, the contribution will undergo a [Code Review Process](/doc/code-review-process.md).

## Definitions

#### Upstream
The main Git repository of the project (this is not the same as the `main` branch). It is common to fork a project to send contributions (see [Sending a contribution](#sending-a-contribution) section). Those forks need to be aligned with the upstream repository.

#### Fork
A personal copy of the upstream repository, owned by the contributor, whose only goal is to allow the contributor to make the changes, test them, and send the pull request. The contributor is responsible to keep this fork aligned with the upstream copy.

#### Origin
The name given to the contributorâ€™s fork.

#### Clean merge
A merge that is performed on a branch, without any other merges in between. Next screenshot shows what IS NOT a clean merge and therefore we get a dirty Git graph. It's difficult to see the scope of each change and rolling back can be nightmare:

![Unclean merge seen from `git log --graph --oneline`](/assets/img/screenshots/unclean-merge-log.png)

In the above tree, branches are merged without rebasing and thus the result pushing the conflicts resolution and testing to the main branch, on merge time. In that scenario, the person who merges the code should solve the possible conflicts and execute the tests to make sure the changes do not break anything. Both things should fall under the responsibility of the committer, the person who made the changes and must understand their scope and implications.

With a proper use of rebase, the committer delivers code ready to merge, conflicts are solved and tests passed on pull request time. Everything is done in the feature/fix branch. Of course, reviewer could also run the tests or make additional testing as part of the review process, that is a separate thing.

## InnerSource Contribution

The process of sending a contribution to an InnerSource project must follow the [guidelines described by the InnerSource Commons community](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourceLearningPath/blob/master/introduction/03-how-works.asciidoc) (please visit the original document to check the current list of people that wrote the document). This section is based on those guidelines, with some modifications.

The process starts when a new feature that is important for an external team or contributor (from now on we simplify it to guest team) is requested to the team in charge of the project (host team) where that feature has to be implemented. The host team is interested in having that feature included in the project. However, the host team is unable to implement that feature in time. At this point, the guest team could decide to implement the feature by themselves and send a pull request to the host team, so the work is ready on time and the host team receive a new feature they did not have time to implement.

There are some issues that should be taken into account and addressed in this document:

* **The guest team should follow the rules of the host team** to make the contribution. That means **those rules must be written and available to them**.

* **Sending the pull requests for review without any prior communication could end with the host team not accepting the pull request due to unforeseen design or implementation problems**. For small features that are not critical to the host team there should be no problem in receiving pull requests for review at any moment. Other more complex solutions would need a more in-depth analysis and discussion. **This process should be clearly written down and publicly available for the guest team so they can decide how to proceed**.

Having said that, the process would be as follows:

* **Guest team identifies a new feature** they need from the host team.

* **Guest team** request that feature to the **host team**.

* **Product owner** has an important role here determining what functionality the host team is interested in accepting as a contribution.

* **Host team** could decide to take the feature or not. If they accept it, they develop the feature as usual and nothing else is needed.

* In other cases, **guest team**, following the rules specified by the **host team**, decides whether to send the pull request directly or, most probably when dealing with medium-to-large sized features, they will inform the **host team** they want to implement the feature by themselves.

* **Host team** verifies the feasibility of the feature and may require some specific information to the **guest team** about how they plan to solve it. **Host team** must ensure the proposal is valid to be accepted in terms of architectural design, coding conventions, dependency usage, or any other requirement they may have. Ideally most of those requirements will be written down within the documentation provided by the **host team**. If new ones are identified, documentation should be updated accordingly as soon as possible.

* **Product owner** ensures the whole process is documented. User stories must be created either by the **host team** or the **guest team** to cover the new feature, including all the needed information for both teams to ensure that the output of the previous point is fully covered.

* **Trusted Committer** will help and guide the **guest team** during the process. **Having the pull request accepted and merged is a common benefit for both parts**, and so it should be understood.

The benefits of this approach are:

* Shared resources.
* Shared knowledge.
* Scalability.
* As far as the process is common to different projects, eases mobility across teams.
* Reduces the time of feature negotiation and escalation processes.

## Sending a contribution

In this project there are two main types of contributions:
* **[Issues](https://github.com/SantanderInnerSource/innersource-project-template/issues)**: any idea, comment or proposal is more than welcome to be discussed. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/SantanderInnerSource/innersource-project-template/issues)!
* **[Pull Requests](https://github.com/SantanderInnerSource/innersource-project-template/pulls)**: any change can be proposed via Pull Request. Please continue reading this document to find more details on this. In case you are unsure about the change, want to propose an important modification either in terms of size or relevance, or if you simply need some help, please open an issue and we will be more than happy to discuss about it.

As this project contains documentation only, changes can be made through the GitHub web interface. For completeness we include here the manual process that is usually followed for code contributions. It applies also to documentation, however the GitHub interface is usually easier for newcomers and people not used to work with Git repositories.

General GitHub workflow rules for contributing via fork apply to our project. [A practical example based on this repository](/doc/pull-request-example.md) is also available to check. Find below a summary of the most important steps:

* Fork the project. See [GitHub documentation on forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)). Make sure you configure the upstream repo as a remote so you will be able to fetch newer changes from upstream later on, if needed.
* Clone your fork locally (`git clone <URL of your fork>`) and enter the local clone.
* Create and set your branch (`git checkout -b <branch_name>`).
* Make your changes. Please, follow the [Additional Documentation](#additional-documentation).
* Push your local branch to **your fork** in GitHub (`git push origin <branch_name>`. Do not push to upstream. Usually you won't have push permission upstream and will get an error, unless you are a trusted committer, in which case please double check your command line!).
* Go to **your fork** in GitHub and request the (assigned) upstream TC's to pull your changes. See [GitHub documentation on how to create a Pull Request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
  * The contributor is responsible of providing commits that allow [clean merges](#clean-merge). In case this doesn't happen, the reviewers will request to rebase the branch and push again the changes.
* Reviewer is responsible of merging changes, even if the contributor has permissions to do it. Merges should look like the following one (obtained via `git log --graph --oneline` command):
![Clean and clear merge seen from `git log --graph --oneline`](/assets/img/screenshots/merge-log.png)
* From the image, is clear:
  * Where the merge was performed.
  * Who merged the changes (not in the image because `--oneline` option was used to summarize the resulting graph).
  * The commits being merged.
  * Who sent those commits (not in the image because `--oneline` option was used to summarize the resulting graph).
  * Ideally only one feature is covered by all of them, no matter if it's split into several commits for clarity, because the tree is clear enough thanks to its shape.

## Branch Policy

This project contains documentation, here we describe a common approach for branching that applies well not only to this case, but also to code oriented repositories.

The main ideas behind the branching strategy explained here are:
  * Keep things as simple as possible.
  * The contributors are fully responsible of their changes.
  * Users are expected to use the latest version released.
  * Anyone should be able to contribute to any project. That means the branching policy should allow anyone to read, but obviously not to write. Assuming a code review process, that means contributors need a branch of their own to make the changes and, from there, open a pull request to the corresponding upstream branch.

By following these ideas, the project `main` branch is the place to go to get the latest changes. Some of them could be still under testing processes. This means `main` is as stable as the testing performed on each Pull Request before merging it into main. It is granted that those changes are part of the roadmap (in other words, may not be fully tested but they are not experimental).

The process of adding new changes to the repository is strongly related to the [review process](/doc/code-review-process.md):
  * Each change will come by means of a pull request.  
  * For that purpose, contributors need to be able to create a specific branch, so they need a fork to create that branch.
  * The branch will be merged into the corresponding upstream branch, being the contributor responsible of the changes needed to perform a clean merge.
  * Once the code is merged, the contributorâ€™s branch can be safely removed.

![Pull Request Schema: Pull Request process from a local branch to upstream ](/assets/img/diagrams/pull-request-schema.png)
<center>Pull Request process from a local branch to upstream </center>

Regarding the project repositoryâ€”defined as upstream aboveâ€”the idea is to keep a structure of branches as simple as possible. In the ideal world, the main branch only receives well-tested changes, so it is stable. In other words, the confidence in main branch stability relies on the confidence on the tests and code reviews.

---
_**From now on, the rest of the section does not apply to this project, but could be useful for bigger repositories**. This is just an example to show different points that should be covered, of course the specific approach each project may want to take for each of them can be different depending on their needs._   

---

At given points of the history, a developer may want to release some versions that will be well tested and cover certain use cases. For that purpose, the proposal is to use tags, so it will be easy to get a specific version of the projects code based on the tags. We could also consider that intermediate versionsâ€”those between tagsâ€”are incomplete or needs some extra validation, so the real stable versions of the code are marked by the release tags.

In case several versions of the project have to co-exist in production at the same time (that is, users do not have to update to the latest version), branches may be created from some release tags. To do this, the policy proposal is as follows:
  * Lazy branch creation. Do not create a release branch if there is nothing to do in the branch yet. Create the branch whenever you need to fix or add something.
  * Define a deprecation date. Release branches cannot be infinitely maintained. Each release should have an end of support date from which the team will not update that version anymore. [Ubuntu releases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) are a well known example that combines regular releases with a life of 9 months and LTS (Long Term Support) releases that offers support for 5 years for main packages (3 in the case of other flavors). [OpenStack 6 months release cycle](https://releases.openstack.org/) is another example of this, where each release has stable points later on within the corresponding release series. Each series has also a given [status or maintenance phase](https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/stable-branches.html#maintenance-phases).
  * Define a merge workflow for fixes and features. Either adding changes to main and then merging them to all release branches or adding changes to one release branch and then merging them to main and the rest of the affected branches could work. There are projects using different policies out there, and there are reasons to choose one or another. Some problems that we may face are:
    * Cherry picking commits from main to release branches is a process that needs to be done carefully to avoid to end up with duplicate commits at some point of the history. It also may cause problems due to changes applied to main that never came to some branches and are needed for the fix or feature to be integrated.
    * Merging from the first affected release to main and the rest of affected releases will grant that the target branches are in a later point of history. However, we may find conflicts due to later changes that were not applied to the first affected release, so we will need to solve those conflicts in order to reintegrate the changes.

In the case of features or fixes that need more than one developer working at the same time the recommendation is to check whether this can be split into smaller and independent features. If there is a dependency among them, the developers should be aware of the blockers and relations to merge them accordingly. Developers could create a specific branch to include all the changes related to a feature inside, and then reintegrate that branch into main. However, to do that developers would need to review things twice. First to merge changes into the feature branch and second to reintegrate the feature branch into main. In addition to that, this second review will be complex because it will include a number of changes. Indeed, if developers follow the Gitflow approach with a develop branch, a third review process will take place. All of these cases will require automatic testing to avoid manual reviews as much as possible.

An example of a very straightforward policy that applies to this specific project is the following:
  * For stable versions, we use tags and releases. Each release is associated to a tag in the repository, so it's easy to get the snapshot of each release if needed.
  * In case of a bug, it will be fixed on the current `main` branch and not backported. **Users are expected to be always in the latest release**, supporting several versions at a time is currently out of the current possibilities of the project in terms of effort.
  * **Corner case**: if this were a code project and a bug broke an older version with not any possibility of updating from that version to a newer one for a representative number of users, a branch would be created from that point, the fix would be applied on that branch and then merged into the `main` branch. The branch created for the fix is expected to be deleted as soon as users of that branch are able to update to the latest release.
  * **Experimental development**: sometimes it is needed to break everything to explore new options for future releases (always under the roadmap of the project) while some developments for the next one are still being tested and pending to be merged. In those cases, a new branch will be created until `main` branch gets to a specific release point. At that point the new branch will be reintegrated into `main`.

This means that most of the time there will be just one or two branches upstream, the rest will be part of the contributors' forks.
