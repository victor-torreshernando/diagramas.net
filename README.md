# InnerSource Project Template

## What is this repository/project?

This project offers a **template** that can be used by anyone willing to create a new project based on resources that are commonly used in **Open Source** projects.

It is a template, but at the same time contains the information of the project itself, so it is itself an example of its application.

Despite of the title, **it should work either for InnerSource or Open Source projects**. Of course it is far from being perfect nor complete, it is just one possible approach. So, it is open to modifications either on your side or by proposing changes to this template via Pull Request. Something that is useful for you, can also be useful for others.


*Please note that italic texts are directions on how to use this template.*

*This file is the standard entry point for newcomers, so make sure you keep it small, understandable and straight-forward. Point to other more detailed resources as needed.*

## Use this software/project

In order to just [use](/INSTALL.md) (download) this repo you don't need to install any tool. Not even git!

## Get in touch

*This section explains how to get in touch with the project team. In order to keep it simple, don't describe all possible interactions (There's a [Governance model](/doc/governance.md) for that), just the first most basic ones...''*

For the moment this project is tiny, so communicating with us is simple and basic.

* Users: Just hover the mouse over the contributors to find who are members and contact any of us. Or open an issue.
* Contributors: For deeper interactions, the [Governance model](/doc/governance.md) should include also pointers to people and communication channels (chat channels, forums, regular meetups, etc), as well as rules, but we're so tiny we don't actually have any of these in this project.
* Other: For any other questions on this project, please contact *dicortazar*.
