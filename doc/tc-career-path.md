# Trusted committer career path

According to [InnerSource Learning Path](https://innersourcecommons.org/learn/learning-path/trusted-committer/01/). The Trusted Committers (TCs from now on) are expected to be responsible of several project aspects like:
* Ensuring certain quality
* Keeping the community healthy
* Reducing the barriers to making contributions
* Upleveling the community
* Advocating the communityâ€™s needs

We see a TC as someone that is a relevant part of the community. To identify TC candidates we look for people that:
* Answer issues. Help others to solve their doubts and problems, showing their knowledge about the project.
* Are polite and welcoming to newcomers, offering help.
* Make contributions to improve the code or add new functionalities.
* Participate in code reviews in a constructive way, even when they are not allowed to approve or merge the changes. Of course it is not mandatory, just a possibility if you have the knowledge to help.
* Participate in public conversation within the community.
* Know the community and they are also known and respected by the community.
* Their contributions are reliable, they learned how to send proper Pull Requests.

The existing project TCs will be aware of those actions and whenever they feel there is a new candidate to be TC, they can propose that person to be a TC. They should send a message to the rest of the TCs mentioning the merits they consider noteworthy. This message must be public, sent to one of [the official communication channels](https://github.com/SantanderInnerSource/innersource-project-template/blob/main/doc/governance.md#collaboration-tools), and the rest of TCs will answer `+1` to approve the proposal, or reasoning why they think that person is still not ready to be TC.
