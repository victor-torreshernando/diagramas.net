# How to use this Template...

## ...as baseline for a new repository

This project is a GitHub template repository. That means you don't need to install anything to use it, just use the `Use this template` button from the [main project page](https://github.com/SantanderInnerSource/innersource-project-template), shown in the screenshot below.

If you need more information about how to use GitHub templates, please [refer to the official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## ...on an existing repository

* Just copy unexisting files to your repository.
* If a file exists you'll need to manually merge cherry-picking the bits you want. Remember that texts in italic are comments for you, the author, not for the final readers!
